A server-side complement to Stripe Checkout

[levity/donate](https://github.com/levity/donate) is a simple, mobile-friendly web page for helping nonprofits accept donations. It accepts credit cards with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout), but Stripe only provides the in-browser experience; some server-side component has to take the credit card token and make the charge. This is that component.
